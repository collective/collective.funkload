For continuous integration, assign labels reflecting the revision
identifier when running the tests and generating the bench results.  A
separate tool can then interpret the revision identifiers, consult
with the VCS to find which of the available labels are appropriate
(yesterday, last week, last month, last year, for example) and
generate the fl-build-label-reports --x-label and --y-label options as
appropriate.
